## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r meta analysis}
my_data<- escalc(n1i = n_controls, n2i = n_patients, m1i = mean_controls, m2i = mean_patients,sd1i = sd_controls, sd2i = sd_patients, data = my_data, measure = "SMD",append=TRUE)
ma_model_1 <- rma(yi, vi, data = my_data)
print(summary(ma_model_1))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=FALSE}
forest(ma_model_1, slab = paste(my_data$study, as.character(my_data$year), sep = ", "))
funnel(ma_model_1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
